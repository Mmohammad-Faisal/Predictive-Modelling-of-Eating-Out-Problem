# Predictive-Modelling-of-Eating-Out-Problem


Restaurant Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling
Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of restaurants in Sydney, Australia, and builds several predictive models to classify restaurant success and predict ratings. The project is divided into two parts:

Part A: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Part B: Predictive Modeling
This README file provides a guide on how to set up, run, and understand the notebook and its corresponding analyses.

Dataset
The dataset contains various features such as restaurant name, cuisine, cost, rating, location, and type. These features are used to explore trends in Sydney’s restaurant industry and to create machine learning models for predictive tasks.

Requirements
The Python notebook requires the following libraries:

pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
numpy: Numerical computations
matplotlib: Static plotting
seaborn: Data visualization
geopandas: Geospatial data analysis
sklearn: Machine learning models and utilities
bokeh: Interactive visualizations
plotly: Interactive plotting
Tableau: For dashboard creation (optional)
You can install these dependencies using the following commands:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn geopandas scikit-learn bokeh plotly
Project Structure
The notebook is organized as follows:

Part A: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Understanding the Dataset:

Displaying basic statistics and information about the dataset.
Visualizing the distribution of features like cuisine, cost, and ratings.
Key Analysis:

Unique Cuisines: How many unique cuisines are served by restaurants?
Top Suburbs: Which suburbs have the highest number of restaurants?
Cost vs. Ratings: Analysis on whether expensive restaurants tend to have better ratings.
Cuisine Density Map: Using geospatial data to plot restaurant density based on cuisine type.
Visualization Tools:

Use of matplotlib, seaborn, and geopandas for static visualizations.
Demonstrating how interactive libraries like bokeh and plotly can overcome limitations of static plots.
Tableau Dashboard (Optional):

Creating and sharing interactive visualizations using Tableau Public.
Part B: Predictive Modeling
Feature Engineering:

Data cleaning and preparation.
Encoding categorical variables for modeling.
Regression Models:

Linear Regression: Predict restaurant ratings using features like cost, cuisine, and location.
Gradient Descent Regression: Alternative method to optimize the linear regression.
Classification Models:

Logistic Regression: Classifying restaurants into two classes based on ratings (e.g., poor/average vs. good/excellent).
Other Classification Models: Comparison of logistic regression with models like Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
Model Evaluation:

Metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression models.
Confusion matrix, precision, recall, and accuracy for classification models.
Running the Notebook
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repo-url>
cd restaurant-analysis
Install required packages: Ensure you have all the necessary Python libraries installed using the requirements.txt file, or manually install the libraries listed above.

Run the Jupyter Notebook: Start the Jupyter Notebook server and open the provided notebook.

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Explore the Notebook: The notebook walks you through EDA, feature engineering, regression, and classification models.

Outputs
Visualizations: Static and interactive plots showcasing cuisine distribution, restaurant ratings vs. cost, and density maps.
Predictive Models: Performance metrics such as MSE, confusion matrices, and classification reports for regression and classification models.
Tableau Dashboard: An optional dashboard on Tableau Public for easy exploration of the restaurant dataset.
Conclusion
This project provides insights into Sydney’s restaurant scene through data analysis and predictive modeling. By understanding the relationships between cost, cuisine, and ratings, and by applying machine learning models, we can predict restaurant success and consumer satisfaction.

Future Improvements
Additional Features: Incorporate external data such as population demographics or online reviews.
Advanced Modeling: Explore advanced machine learning models like neural networks or ensemble methods.
Model Deployment: Deploy models as a web app using Flask or Streamlit.
